Hello there

for all animations the 1st, 3rd and 5th are idle sprites, while the rest are walking in respective direction. 
First 2 rows are walking downwards, 3rd and 4th are walking top, 5th and 6th are walking side. 

For the portraits, I have made 2 option for the character with glasses. One with eyes visible, one with 
eyes covered. Each animation is split in different columns. FIrst pair of columns is idle blinking. 
Next columns are as follows, talking, angry talking and one frame idle sad.

Best of luck and thanks for buying this pack! 
If you have any questions or spot any visual bugs or issues please let me know.
